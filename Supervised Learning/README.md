# Supervised Learning
The aim of supervised learning is finding patterns in data that is labeled. Specefically, being able to take a point and predict which label it should have. We will consider the following algorithms:

* Perceptron: classifies data by a straight line
* Linear Regression: predicts values using a hyper-plane (straight line)
* Logistic Regression: more robust probabilistic binary classification
* Neural Network: combines many different "neurons" of the previous three methods for more complex classifcation and regression
* K Nearest Neighbors: classifies a data point as the same type as its nearest neighbors 
* Decision Trees: the model learns yes or no questions to classify data
* Random Forests (and Ensemble Methods): combining multiple machine learning methods -- specefically multiple decision trees for Random Forests.
