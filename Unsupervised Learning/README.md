# Unsupervised Learning
The aim of unsupervised learning is finding patterns in data that is unlabeled. Specefically, finding groups (or clusters) within the data. We will consider the following algorithms:

* K-Means Clustering: find $k$ clusters in the data.
* DBSCAN: finding clusters based on the density of points.
* PCA: turning higher dimensional data into lower more managemable dimensions.
* Label Propogation (on Graphs): finding clusters in undirected graphs.
